# Open Robust Compartmentalization Alliance (ORCA) Governance Policy 1.0

This document provides the governance policy for specifications, source code,
data and other documents developed under the Open Robust Compartmentalization
Alliance (ORCA) using the Community Specification process in repositories in the
ORCA-LF GitHub organization (the "Project"). The Project and its participants
must adhere to the requirements in this document. This document is derived from
the [Community Specifications Governance Policy 1.0](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/1.0/blob/master/5._Governance.md).

ORCA may comprise multiple "Workstreams." These Workstreams represent different
pillars of specification work or software implementations. Workstreams are not
strictly tied to unique repositories in the ORCA-LF GitHub organization.

## 1.	Roles.

Each Project may include the following roles. Additional roles may be adopted
and documented by the Technical Steering Committee.

**1.1. Participants.** "Participants" are individuals that have contributed to
or participated in the ORCA community, such as by attending meetings, engaging
in conversations on Slack, or commenting on documents.

**1.2. Contributors.** "Contributors" are those Participants that have (a) made
Contributions to the Project (e.g., specification changes) and/or (b)
contributed code, data or documentation to Project assets. E.g. creating a PR,
reviewing a PR, and editing a specification in a document.

**1.3.	Maintainers.** "Maintainers" are responsible for reviewing and merging
all proposed changes, and they guide the overall technical direction of a
Workstream within the guidelines established by the Technical Steering
Committee. Each Workstream will record its Maintainers in a MAINTAINERS.md file
in the appropriate repositories and/or path locations.

Maintainers may be added through majority approval of existing Maintainers,
based on the following criteria:

* Demonstrated track record of PR reviews (both quality and quantity of reviews)
* Demonstrated thought leadership in the Project
* Demonstrated shepherding of a Workstream and contributors

Maintainers may be removed by explicit resignation, for prolonged inactivity
(e.g., 3 or more months with no review comments), for some infraction of the
code of conduct, or for consistently demonstrating poor judgment. A proposed
removal also requires a majority approval. A Maintainer removed for inactivity
may be restored following a sustained resumption of contributions and reviews
(a month or more) demonstrating a renewed commitment to the project.

**1.4. Technical Steering Committee Members.** The "Technical Steering
Committee" (the "TSC") is the body that is responsible for overseeing the
overall activities of the Project. The TSC consists of 5 community-elected
Participants (each a "Technical Steering Committee Member") following the date 
of initial adoption of this ORCA Governance Policy. The responsibilities and
TSC Member terms are described in detail.

## 2. Technical Steering Committee.

**2.1 TSC Member Responsibilities.**
Members of the ORCA TSC are expected to:

* Enable the smooth running of the Project
* Actively participate within the ORCA community
* Collectively review and revise the Project vision, mission, strategy, and
  roadmap at least once a year, or more frequently if needed
* Meet regularly, no less than once a quarter and publish TSC meeting notes
* Participate in strategic planning, such as coordinating face-to-face meetings
  or suggesting and approving changes to the governance model
* Review the lifecycle of existing and proposed Workstreams within the Project
  with the consensus input from the community of Participants
* Respond to specific issues or concerns above and beyond the domain of the
  various workstreams
* Make decisions when community consensus cannot be reached, pursuant to the
  appeal process documented below
* Hold Maintainers accountable to the standards of what makes ORCA an effective 
  Project and representative of a diverse community of Participants and
  Contributors. In the rare event that a majority of existing Maintainers are
  unavailable to review PRs for an extended period of time, the TSC may add or
  remove Maintainers to bring a Workstream back to a functioning state
* Administer the ORCA-LF GitHub organization, including mananging GitHub Team
  memberships for Maintainers, managing organization-wide security policies
  (e.g., branch protection rules, secrets management, etc.)
  
**2.2 TSC Member Terms and Election.**
The ORCA TSC is composed of 5 individuals, each representing a different
affiliation, and all of whom are elected by the community. TSC seats are for
two-year terms, 50% of which (i.e., alternating 2 and 3 seats) are open for
community vote every year.

One month before the expiration of a TSC Member term, the current TSC shall
open a call for nominations to fill all open seats. Any community Participant
may submit a self-nomination, which must include the following information:

* Affiliation / employer
* Evidence of active participation in the community and being well-versed in
  the ORCA mission and strategy
* Statement of intent to perform the duties of a TSC Member during the next term

The nomination period should last two weeks. After the nomination period, the
voting period should begin and last one week. All Participants are eligible to
vote for TSC Members. The current TSC Members will tally the votes and announce
the new TSC Members.

An individual may be nominated for and serve any number of successive terms.
However, TSC Members are encouraged to allow other longstanding Participants to
contribute as TSC Members.

TSC Members must resign if they become inactive, by not performing the duties as
stated in 2.1. When a TSC Member resigns or is removed, an election must be
held to replace the Member, following the procedure for nominations and
elections as discussed above.

Nominations and decisions must be publicly recorded via on GitHub issues for
transparency.

## 3. Decision Making.

**3.1. Consensus-Based Decision Making.**  Projects make decisions through a
consensus process (“Approval” or “Approved”).  While the agreement of all
Participants is preferred, it is not required for consensus.  Rather, the
Maintainers or TSC (as applicable) will determine consensus based on their good
faith consideration of a number of factors, including the dominant view of the
Project Participants and nature of support and objections. The Maintainers or
TSC (as applicable) will document evidence of consensus in accordance with these
requirements. 

**3.2. Appeal Process.** Decisions may be appealed be via a GitHub pull request
or an issue, and that appeal will be considered by the applicable Maintainer in
good faith, who will respond in writing within a reasonable time.

**3.3. TSC Appeal Process.** Decisions that have been appealed to the
Maintainers may in extraordinary cases be escalated to the Technical Steering
Committee for reconsideration. An appeal to the TSC must specify in detail (1)
the specific decision that is being appealed; (2) the basis for contending that
the decision was not aligned with the purposes, goals or scope of the Project;
and (3) an explanation of why the decision is extraordinary enough to warrant
an appeal to the TSC. The appeal will be considered by the TSC in good faith,
who will respond in writing within a reasonable time. The TSC may decline to
consider appeals that are unexceptional, unfounded or excessive, including
because of their repetitive character.

**3.4. Amendments to Governance Documents.** The documents in this Governance
repository may be amended by four of the five Technical Steering Committee
Members and are subject to approval by The Linux Foundation. However, entries
may be added to the [Notices](3._Notices.md) in this Governance repository as
described therein.

## 4.	Ways of Working.

Inspired by [ANSI’s Essential Requirements for Due Process](https://share.ansi.org/Shared%20Documents/Standards%20Activities/American%20National%20Standards/Procedures,%20Guides,%20and%20Forms/2020_ANSI_Essential_Requirements.pdf),
Community Specification Projects must adhere to consensus-based due process
requirements. These requirements apply to activities related to the development
of consensus for approval, revision, reaffirmation, and withdrawal of Community
Specifications. Due process means that any person (organization, company,
government agency, individual, etc.) with a direct and material interest has a
right to participate by: a) expressing a position and its basis, b) having that
position considered, and c) having the right to appeal. Due process allows for
equity and fair play. The following constitute the minimum acceptable due
process requirements for the development of consensus.

**4.1. Openness.** Participation shall be open to all persons who are directly
and materially affected by the activity in question. There shall be no undue
financial barriers to participation. Voting membership on the consensus body
shall not be conditional upon membership in any organization, nor unreasonably
restricted on the basis of technical qualifications or other such requirements.
Membership in a Project’s parent organization, if any, may be required.

**4.2. Lack of Dominance.** The development process shall not be dominated by
any single interest category, individual or organization. Dominance means a
position or exercise of dominant authority, leadership, or influence by reason
of superior leverage, strength, or representation to the exclusion of fair and
equitable consideration of other viewpoints.

**4.3. Balance.** The development process should have a balance of interests.
Participants from diverse interest categories shall be sought with the objective
of achieving balance.

**4.4. Coordination and Harmonization.** Good faith efforts shall be made to
resolve potential conflicts between and among deliverables developed under this
Project and existing industry standards.

**4.5. Consideration of Views and Objections.** Prompt consideration shall be
given to the written views and objections of all Participants.

**4.6. Written procedures.** This governance document and other materials
documenting the Community Specification development process shall be available
to any interested person.

## 5. Specification Development Process.

**5.1. Draft.** At any point during the development process, Participants may
submit issues and pull requests to any ORCA-LF repository. Issues and pull
requests will be reviewed and merged following the
[Contributing policy](6._Contributing.md).
Each updated version of an ORCA specification following the merging of a pull
request will be considered a "Draft Specification".

**5.2. Project Approval.** Once a Workstream believes it has achieved its
objectives as described in the Scope, the applicable Maintainers will Approve
that Draft Specification and progress it to "Approved Specification" status.
The following process will be used:

* The Maintainers will distribute that version of the Draft Specification to
  the Project's primary mailing list.
* The Maintainers will state in the distribution that the Draft Specification is
  a candidate for "Approved Specification" status, and will announce the start
  of a two-week review period (the "Review Period").
* During the Review Period, Participants may raise any issues regarding the
  Draft Specification. Such issues will be considered and resolved in the
  ordinary course.
* The Maintainers may, at their discretion, extend the Review Period for a
  longer period of time, but will not shorten it to be less than the initial
  two-week period.
* After the completion of the Review Period and upon the Approval of the
  specification (which may include the resolution of any issues raised during
  the Review Period), the Draft Specification will be progressed to be an
  "Approved Specification".

**5.3. Publication and Submission.** Upon the designation of a Draft
Specification as an Approved Specification, the Maintainers will publish the
Approved Specification in a manner agreed upon by the Project Participants
(i.e., Project Participant only location, publicly available location, Project
maintained website, Project member website, etc.). The publication of an
Approved Specification in a publicly accessible manner must include the terms
under which the Approved Specification is being made available under.

**5.4. Submissions to Standards Bodies.** No Draft Specification or Approved
Specification may be submitted to another standards development organization
without TSC Approval. Upon reaching Approval, the Maintainers will coordinate
the submission of the applicable Draft Specification or Approved Specification
to another standards development organization. The Contributors that developed
that Draft Specification or Approved Specification agree to grant the copyright
rights necessary to make those submissions.

## 6. Non-Confidential, Restricted Disclosure.

Information disclosed in connection with any Project activity, including but
not limited to meetings, Contributions, and submissions, is not confidential,
regardless of any markings or statements to the contrary. Technical Steering
Committee meeting minutes will be published in summary form, as appropriate 
e.g., sensitive matters may not be made public). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if the Project is collaborating via a private repository, the Participants will
not make any public disclosures of that information contained in that private
repository without the Approval of the Project.
