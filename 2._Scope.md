# Scope

The Open Robust Compartmentalization Alliance (ORCA) brings together
stakeholders from academia, industry, and government to develop techniques 
for robust compartmentalization, which composably, efficiently, securely and
usably isolates components within a program at execution time.

ORCA envisions a future where bugs and vulnerabilities are securely, efficiently
and usably contained in a composable way.

ORCA's scope encompasses addressing gaps in four pillars of robust
compartmentalization (security, composability, efficiency, usability) by:

* Championing harmonious composition between different compartmentalization
  abstractions, mechanisms, and policy definitions.

* Serving as a knowledge base via 1) open forums for knowledge sharing between
  different stakeholders (researchers, developers, integrators, end users,
  sponsors), via 2) resources to enhance cybersecurity education curricula as a
  way to increase engagement in this space and demystify the technologies as
  "expert-only", and 3) establishing and role-modeling best practices for
  practitioners.
  
* Facilitating development & adoption by 1) identifying and supporting the best
 approach for solving a particular class of use cases, 2) facilitating adoption
 and retrofitting to granular component compartmentalization, and 3)
 methodically deploying rigorously validated compartmentalization with continual
 feedback from stakeholders.
